# Introduction

This is a project where RNN and LSTM model is built using no
Deep learning libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, keras etc.
The RNN model and LSTM model are built using numpy module and
trained on shakespeare dataset.

## Usage

To run the RNN model:

	* Run the command: python rnntest.py

To run the LSTM model:
	
	* Run the command: python lstmtest.py
